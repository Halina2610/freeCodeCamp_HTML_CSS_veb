          Calling all Potterheads. HBO Max officially announced a reboot of its
          iconic Harry Potter series this spring, and the Internet had quite a
          bit to say about it (including a planned boycott). Rumors of a
          proposed Harry Potter series have been circulating for a while, but
          the platform finally confirmed the news on Twitter, stating that
          episodes will be released on the new Warner Bros. Discovery platform
          "Max", which will replace HBO Max on May 23.
        </p>

          tweet included a brief teaser trailer of the new television series,
          but the video didn't give much insight into what it may hold (aside
          from nostalgia for the original Harry Potter movie series, which
          concluded its eight-movie run in 2011). J.K. Rowling, Neil Blair, and
          Ruth Kenley-Letts will serve as executive producers on the show, and
          there's even some chatter that David Heyman, executive producer for
          all Harry Potter movies, could join the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This new Max Original series will dive deep into each of the iconic
          books that fans have continued to enjoy for all of these years,” said
          Chairman and CEO of HBO & Max, Casey Bloys, per Deadline. He added
          that the show would be “a faithful adaptation.”

          The Harry Potter franchise has been active in the years since the last
          movie came out—from the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play (which
          was made into a book, and is in talks for a film adaptation), the
          Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them film series (which follows the
          fictional historical figure Newt Scamander), and a recently-launched
          video game called Hogwarts Legacy.

          This will, however, be the first *official* remake of the original
          movies, which stared Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint,
          a.k.a. Harry, Ron and Hermione. Here's everything to know (so far)
          about the upcoming Max series.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>The full series is expected to be released over a decade.</h2>
        <p>
          Similar to the original Harry Potter films, which ran from 2001 to
          2011, the upcoming Harry Potter series is expected to be released over
          the next 10 years. Given the proposed timeline, each season will
          likely center around one of the Harry Potter books—which include seven
          titles, released between 1997 and 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will likely start airing some time in 2025 or 2026, per
          <a

      <article>
        <h2>What will happen in the series?</h2>
        <p>
          The reboot aims to give a new generation of Harry Potter fans a chance
          to "discover Hogwarts in a whole new way," says Casey Bloys, the
          chairman and chief executive of HBO and Max content, per
          <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/business/media/harry-potter-tv-show-max.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimesarts"

            The New York Times.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The upcoming series also aims to be a "faithful adaptation" of the
          Harry Potter novels, per a statement obtained by The New York Times.
          This probably means Harry Potter fans will finally get to meet the
          Hogwarts Poltergeist, Peeves, and see Hermione's House Elf activism in
          Book 4 (these were left out of the movies).
        </p>
        <p>
          The series will be released on the new Max platform, and will be
          available internationally.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>When does the new series air?</h2>
        <p>
          There's still no word on when production would start for the Harry
          Potter remake or when it would be released.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given that most shows on HBO Max have about two years between seasons,
          it's unlikely the new Harry Potter series would hit the streamer
          before 2025, but perhaps they will use a Time Turner on set and finish
          it more quickly.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>Who will be in the cast?</h2>
        <p>
          It's unclear if the show has been cast yet, so the full cast list
          remains to be seen, but execs have said it will feature an entirely
          new cast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, fans excited for the upcoming series have responded on social
          media with cast theories (which include Adam Driver as Snape and Tom
          Felton as Lucius Malfoy—I'm not sure about that!).

      <article>
        <h2>Is there a trailer yet?</h2>
        <p>
          Nope. Also no trailer, aside from the announcement from HBO Max. You
          can be sure that as soon as one drops, it'll be right he re waiting
          for you.

          to me, and I’m looking forward to being part of this new adaptation
          which will allow for a degree of depth and detail only afforded by a
          long-form television series,” J.K. Rowling said in a statement, per
          The New York Times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rowling served as a producer on the final two installments of the
          Harry Potter films, and the first three films in the Fantastic Beasts
          and Where To Find Them series (and will continue for the next two

        <h2>Some fans have called for a boycott.</h2>
        <p>
          The Max remake, and particularly Rowling's involvement in it, have
          been met with some mixed feelings online. Some have criticized the
          show as a clear play for more cash, and expressed doubt about how
          quickly a 7-season show can be cranked out. But most complaints stem
          from ongoing resistance to J.K. Rowling's transphobia. Rowling
          maintains that she is not transphobic, but she often contradicts
          herself in her statements and public comments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rowling recently responded on Twitter, writing: “Activists in my
          mentions are trying to organise yet another boycott of my work, this
          time of the Harry Potter TV show... As forewarned is forearmed, I’ve
          taken the precaution of laying in a large stock of champagne,” she
          wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, Rowling began making anti-transgender remarks publicly, which
          led many fans to "cancel" and denounce her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Harry Potter cast has spoken out against Rowling's statements, per
          Variety. Daniel Radcliffe, who ICYDK starred as the titular role in
          the original films, released a full statement responding to J.K.
          Rowling's transphobia in June 2020 through the Trevor Project website.

            target="_blank"
            >Trevor Project</a
          >
          is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as a crisis
          intervention platform for at-risk LGBT youth. Earlier this year,
          Radcliffe hosted a roundtable for trans youth through the
          organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022, Rowling was noticeably absent from the Harry Potter 20th
          Anniversary Special: Return To Hogwarts. The author claimed she
          declined the invitation because she felt it was "about the films more
          than the books quite rightly," per Variety. Later that same year,
          Radcliffe also said he was uninterested in revisiting his Harry Potter
          role, per
          <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/movies/the-lost-city-sandra-bullock-channing-tatum-daniel-radcliffe.html"
            target="_blank"
            >The New York Times</a
          >, because not enough time has past since the last Harry Potter film
          was released.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need your Harry Potter fix now, you can watch the films on
          Peacock and HBO Max. After all, the last time anyone got new HP
          content was over a decade ago.
